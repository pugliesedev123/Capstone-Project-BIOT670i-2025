Image Classifier Training Directory Structure
=============================================

This classifier expects a specific directory and file naming structure to ensure
that ownership, taxonomic identity, and optional morphological metadata are clearly recorded.

1. Owner Layer (required)
-------------------------
Top-level folder indicating data owner or contributor:

    owner-[owner_name]

Example:
    owner-JSmith

2. Taxon Layer (required for biological specimens)
--------------------------------------------------
Subfolder under each owner directory, representing the taxonomic identity.
Use consistent taxon names across all owner folders.

    taxon-[taxon_name]

Accepted values include species, genus, family, etc.

Example:
    owner-JSmith/
        taxon-Carcharhinus_leucas/

3. Image Files (required for training)
--------------------------------------
Individual image files inside each taxon or mineral folder should be named with an index in parentheses:

    [taxon_or_mineral_name] (1).jpg
    [taxon_or_mineral_name] (2).jpg
    ...

This ensures consistency and compatibility with the classifier's input structure.

If available, additional metadata such as tooth position or age may be tracked externally or in a separate documentation file.

4. Mineral Layer (optional)
---------------------------
To support classification of common associated minerals, folders may be labeled using:

    mineral-[mineral_name]

These folders contain mineral image files and are treated separately from biological taxonomy.

Example:
    owner-JSmith/
        mineral-quartz/
            quartz (1).jpg
        mineral-pyrite/
            pyrite (1).jpg

Mineral files may also appear within biological taxon folders if associated directly with a specimen:

    caracharhinus_leucas (1).jpg
    pyrite (1).jpg

Example Structure:
------------------
    owner-JSmith/
        taxon-Carcharhinus_leucas/
            caracharhinus_leucas (1).jpg
            caracharhinus_leucas (2).jpg
            caracharhinus_leucas (3).jpg
            pyrite (1).jpg

        mineral-quartz/
            quartz (1).jpg

Summary Notes:
--------------
- Use snake_case or lowercase formatting.
- Avoid spaces and special characters in folder and file names.
- Taxon names must be used consistently across all owner folders.
- Image files must use the (1), (2), ... format.
- Morphotype and mineral metadata may be tracked separately in documentation.
